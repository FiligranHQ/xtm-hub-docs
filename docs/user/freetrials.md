# Free trials

## Start an OpenCTI free trial

Starting a trial gives users access to a dedicated OpenCTI Enterprise Edition platform for 30 days.
Each organization is generally entitled to only one free trial. Trials cannot be started for personal organizations.

If Filigran does not have enough capacity to host the trial in the requested region, the user will be notified and 
may either select a different region or join a waiting list for the preferred region.
