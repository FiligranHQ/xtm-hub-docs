By default, the first user who logs in to the XTM Hub becomes the **Organization Administrator**.

### Access the Users Page

## Approve New Team Members

When a new user logs in to the XTM Hub and their email domain matches the administrator’s domain, they are marked as a **Pending User**.

The Organization Administrator must approve their request before they can join the organization.

# Personal Space

The **Personal Space** is a special type of organization designed for individual use.

- You are the only member.
- You cannot invite other users.
- You cannot start a product trial from this space.

However, it is fully configurable and intended to give you flexibility for personal use.

To go on this personal space, click on your organization top left and select the one you want to work on.
