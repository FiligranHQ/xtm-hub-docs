# OpenAEV Platform Registration


To utilize features such as one-click deployments, your OpenAEV platform must be registered (available from OpenAEV 2.0.0).

The registration process is initiated from your OpenAEV platform. For more detailed information, please refer to the [OpenAEV documentation](https://docs.openbas.io/latest/administration/hub).
